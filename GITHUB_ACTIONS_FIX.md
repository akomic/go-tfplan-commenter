# GitHub Actions Release Fix

## Problem
The original GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
```

## Root Causes
1. **Deprecated Actions**: Using `actions/create-release@v1` and `actions/upload-release-asset@v1` which are deprecated
2. **Missing Permissions**: The workflow lacked proper permissions for creating releases
3. **Complex Asset Upload**: Multiple separate steps for uploading each binary

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Added proper permissions**:
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: write
    packages: write
  ```
- **Replaced deprecated actions** with `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`
- **Simplified asset upload** - single step uploads all files
- **Better error handling** and release notes generation

### 2. Alternative GoReleaser Workflow (`.github/workflows/goreleaser.yml`)
- **Industry standard** tool for Go project releases
- **Automatic cross-compilation** and asset management
- **Built-in checksums** and archive creation
- **Professional release notes** formatting

### 3. Enhanced Installation Script (`install.sh`)
- **Dual format support** - works with both manual builds and GoReleaser
- **Fallback mechanism** - tries GoReleaser format first, then direct binaries
- **Better error handling** and user feedback
- **Platform detection** improvements

### 4. Comprehensive Testing (`main_test.go`)
- **Unit tests** for core functions
- **Edge case coverage** for error conditions
- **Validation** of markdown generation
- **CI integration** ensures code quality

## Workflow Options

### Option 1: Manual Build Workflow (Recommended for now)
- File: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Uses: `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`
- Pros: Full control, simple setup
- Cons: Manual build configuration

### Option 2: GoReleaser Workflow (Future upgrade)
- File: `.github/workflows/goreleaser.yml`
- Uses: `goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v5`
- Pros: Industry standard, automatic features
- Cons: Additional configuration file

## Testing the Fix

1. **Create a new tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

2. **Monitor the workflow**:
   - Go to GitHub Actions tab
   - Watch the "Build and Release" workflow
   - Verify release creation and asset uploads

3. **Test installation**:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akomic/go-tfplan-commenter/main/install.sh | bash
   ```

## Key Improvements

1. ✅ **Fixed permissions** - Workflow can now create releases
2. ✅ **Modern actions** - Using supported, maintained actions
3. ✅ **Simplified process** - Single step for all asset uploads
4. ✅ **Better UX** - Improved release notes and installation
5. ✅ **Comprehensive testing** - Unit tests prevent regressions
6. ✅ **Dual workflow options** - Choose between manual or GoReleaser

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current workflow** with a new tag
2. **Consider migrating to GoReleaser** for future releases
3. **Add integration tests** with actual Terraform plan files
4. **Set up automated security scanning** for releases

The workflow should now successfully create releases with all binary assets attached!
